<H3>A brief introduction</H3>
<p>	Hello there Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sure you're wondering how I've been and what is all this?</p>
<p>Well There's a simple answer to that question!</p>
<p>I've been ruthlessly shunned and exiled multiple times and also went through a LOT of drama but all is good now</p>
<p>I've since been working on my sphere of influence and started a new discord server which you should see above</p>
<p>Of course this website needs to serve a purpose, right?</p>
<p>Well it does!</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't figured it out the video tab has a single line of text that says "for members"</p>
<p>by clicking on that text and entering "Axoloz_Power.xml" you can access the hidden videos I have!</p>
<p>they mostly have stuff to do with FYjang and other stuff that I can't really post on my channel.</p>
<p>I'm also going to add unlisted youtube videos I have to that very site!</p>
<p>This update was really just meant to let you know how I've been, what's been happening, and what this site hides.</p>
<p>That's all so thank you!</p>
